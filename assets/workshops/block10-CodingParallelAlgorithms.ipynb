    "\n",
    "Here we will put to practice the ideas described in the lecture, notably:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vectorisation,\n",
    "* Native Accumulation,\n",
    "* The **Map** function,\n",
    "* The **Reduce** function, and its **accumulate** variant,\n",
    "* The **multiprocessing** environment for parallelisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until the final section, everything is only about preparing for parallelism. **Parallel code in python is non-trivial** because it needs to access additional cores that it may not have permission for. There are many different implementations that variously:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't work across operating systems,\n",
    "* Don't work in Jupyter but work in native python,\n",
    "* Work in python 2/3 but not vice versa,\n",
    "* Any combination of the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule, **you should not include parallel code inside a notebook** because it is not likely to be cross-platform. By nature of needing to paralellise, it is worth outsourcing important parallel code to a script and running this remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find that everything here **works on Notable via Blackboard**. I have also provided script files to complete the same parallelisation in Windows via native python. However the script solution we identify is adequate and is the recommended solution, so if your project group wants to work with parallel code and anyone runs Windows, **This Is The Way**.\n",
