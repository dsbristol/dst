    "# 08.3 Workshop on the Empirical evaluation of computational complexity\n",

    "date: \"Block 08\"\n",
    "author: \"Daniel Lawson\"\n",

    "0. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is about understanding computational complexity and exploring how to display this in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source ideas for this workshop were inspired by\n",
    "<https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-time-complexity-with-python-examples-2bda6e8158a7>, though the implementations vary from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the standard conventions for time complexity, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $O(n)$ means that the maximum run time is bounded by a linear function in $n$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms below are close to deterministic. However, some algorithms vary in **Amortized** time, or in **average case** complexity. Repeating the analysis below with carefully chosen functions to demonstrate the different scaling would be very valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the distinction between worst-case and typical-case is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if an algorithm may be run over most potential inputs, \n",
    "* if these might be chosen adversarially, or \n",
    "* if benchmarking of an algorithm is done for a rather different section of input space to where it might be deployed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The run time, and the memory requirement scaling are two of the most important quantities. Memory requirements are usually (but not always) easily bounded and few algorithms have massive variation in memory requirement (it is an undesirable feature for e.g. parallelisation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical note:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a tradeoff in making self-contained code, and correctly benchmarked code, which arises because of the need to generate data for the algorithms below. Rather than generate data externally we have elected to do it within the timing loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data generation is an $O(N)$ activity. This breaks some of the asymptotics, as generating data plus searching it using a logarithmic algorithm is asymptotically dominated by the generation time. However, the constants are sufficiently different that for the scale of experiments perfomed here, the search cost dominates and we see the correct behaviour!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important lesson in the difference between theory and practice. Constants do matter.\n",
