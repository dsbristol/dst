Pyspark and Hadoop repository for learning

This is part of [Block 11](https://dsbristol.github.io/dst/coursebook/11.html) of the [Data Science Toolbox](https://dsbristol.github.io/dst/coursebook.html), where there are detailed discussions about **why** we structure distributed data processing in this way.

This content has the following sections, which work through the provided material:

* [11.2.0 Installation Notes](11.2.0%20Install%20notes.md), which explains installation on your personal (Windows or Mac) machine.
* [11.2.1 on Hadoop](11.2.1%20Hadoop%20On%20BC4.sh), which **must be run on BC4**, unless you want to go through the bother of installing Hadoop manually (not recomended).
* [11.2.2 on Pyspark in Jupyter](11.2.2%20Pyspark%20from%20Jupyter.ipynb), which is the **main component** of the learning.
* [11.2.3 on Pyspark on BC4](11.2.3%20Pyspark%20on%20BC4.sh), which replicates all content from the Jupyter section, but in a format that is appropriate for running on the cluster. You **can** follow the Jupyter notebook whilst running all code from this section on BC4. However this is not recommended.
