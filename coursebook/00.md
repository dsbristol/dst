# About the Course.

## Schedule

For every active week there is a corresponding coursebook page, called Blocks 01-11, which you can access in the [Coursebook](../coursebook.md).

A typical week contains:
* 2 lectures
* 1 interactive workshop. You need to **check the content in advance** of the workshop as there is often **preparation work**.
* 1 portfolio (i.e. longform assessed homework, due at the end of the course).
* 1 Noteable worksheet (multiple choice assessed homework).

## Timing and content

Content will be made available at least 1 week prior to the scheduled week for the Block in the [Timetable](../timetable.md).

## Updated material - versioning

All material has versioning information included. The version used for Lectures may have contained minor issues which will be updated; you will know if this has happened through the updated version. The content starts at v1.0.1 in the format `v<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>`. Bugfix version changes should not require attention; minor changes may affect some small aspect of the content, whilst you will receive clear signposting for major changes where the structure and intent may also have changed.
