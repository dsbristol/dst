Students on the [MSc Mathematics of Cybersecurity](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2020/sci/msc-mathematics-of-cybersecurity/) have access to [bluecrsytal phase 4](https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/acrc/phase4.htm). The process is as follows:
* I send an email to service-desk-hpc@bristol.ac.uk containing SURNAME FIRSTNAME USERNAME EMAIL
* This creates your account.
* Do students have to apply to have their accounts activated? https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/login-area/apply.cgi
* To log on follow the instructions [here](https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/protected/bc4-docs/access/index.html)
* You should create an and place it on BlueCrystal similarly to as you did for [GitHub ](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), to enable password-less access.
  - You [add your public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-setup-passwordless-ssh-login/) on Bluecrystal
  - You can do this by copying files or pasting text into the file using a file editor.
  - This might require using a command-line editor
* To connect you will need to be on the University of Bristol [VPN](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/vpn.aspx).

In Data Science Toolbox, we will be using this primarily for:

* Large Compute Jobs;
* GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) jobs, specifically for learning Neural Networks.
