# 02 Regression and Statistical Testing

This is a very important content-heavy block, in which the lectures are longer than usual, and the workshop is shorter to make up for it.

In Block 02, we cover:

* Classical Regression:
  - How to implement regression in practice
  - How to interpret regression outputs
  - Standard and Logistic regression
* Modern Regression:
  - Matrix formulation of multivariate regression.
  - Elements of multivariate calculus
* Statistical Testing:
  - Classical statistical testing
  - Resampling approaches to statistical testing
  - Model evaluation using Cross Validation
* Implementations in R:
  * Regression for time series
  * Regression for feature matrices

## Lectures:

### Regression:

* [02.1-Modern Regression]({{ site.data.block02.s0101-Regression.url }})
  * [Matrix Multiplication Cheat Sheet](02-MatrixCheatsheet.md)
* [Reference R code]({{ site.data.block02.c01-Regression.url }})

### Statistical Testing and Model Selection:

 [02.2-Statistical Testing]({{ site.data.block02.s0201-Testing.url }})
* [Reference R code]({{ site.data.block02.c02-Testing.url }})

## Worksheets:

* [Worksheet 2.1 Regression and Correlation]({{ site.data.block02.ws01.url }}) 
* [Worksheet 2.2 Statistical Testing]({{ site.data.block02.ws02.url }})
* [Portfolio 02]({{ site.data.block02.portfolio.url }})

## Preparation:

If you have not completed the [Block 1 Preparation](01.md), please do so.

## Workshop:

* [02.3 Model Selection (.Rmd)]({{ site.data.block02.s03-ModelSelection.url }})

## Assessments:

* The full [Portfolio]({{ site.data.individualassessment1.url }}) will be set in this week; see [Assessments](../assessments.md). This is a summative assessment (i.e. does contribute to your grade) and will be due in Week 13, but contains material to work on each week.

## Reference material:
