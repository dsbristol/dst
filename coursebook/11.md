# 11 Ethics and Privacy

In this block we cover:

* What laws govern data science?
* What is Ethical data science?
* What is privacy? 
* How can we design data science tools to protect it? 
* What is Statistical disclosure?
  * An introduction to differential privacy...
* What is interpretability in terms of machine learning algorithms?
* What is algorithmic bias?  How can we mitigate it?
