# 01 Introduction

Welcome to Data Science Toolbox!

This week we will prepare you for your Data Science Journey. It is essential that you have prepared before our contact time. That means:

* See and reflect of the Lectures;
* Look at the worksheets and think about the questions; as a minimum, make notes on how you might go about answering them;
* Most importantly, **look at the Workshop content** and do the **pre-preparation** for it.

This week demands the most work to allow you to hit the ground running. There is less content in future weeks.

## Lectures:

* 1.0 [Introduction to the course](/dst/assets/videos/01.0.mov)
* 1.1 [Introduction to Data Science](/dst/assets/videos/01.1.mov)
  * [Slides](/dst/assets/slides/01-Intro.pdf)
* 1.2 [Exploratory Data analysis](/dst/assets/videos/01.2.mov)
  * [Slides](/dst/assets/slides/02-EDA.pdf)
  * [Reference R code](/dst/assets/code/01.1-EDA.R)

## Worksheets:

* [Worksheet 1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis](/dst/assets/worksheets/ws01.2_questions.pdf)

## Preparation:

* Everyone needs to have followed the Section 01 part of [Appendix 1](appendix1-prep.md).
* Specifically, you must have installed Rstudio and Github Desktop, and seen the appropriate training content.
* You cannot properly use the interaction time unless you have done this preparation **in advance**!

## Workshop:

In the workshop, we will be discussing how to collaborate and work together remotely. We will then discuss Exploratory Data Analysis in practice.

* 1.3 [Workshop Lecture on Exploratory Data analysis](/dst/assets/videos/01.2.mov)
* [01 Exploratory Data Analysis R markdown](/dst/assets/workshops/block01-eda.Rmd)

## Assessments:

* Assessment 1 will be set in this week. This is a formative assessment (i.e. does not contribute to your grade) and will be due in Week 3.
