# 01 Introduction

Welcome to Data Science Toolbox!

This week we will prepare you for your Data Science Journey. 

### Overview:

In Block 01, we cover:

* What is Data Science Toolbox?
  * Use of Group Assessments.
* What is Data Science?
* An overview of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  * Exploratory Data Analysis with R.
* Setting up a basic Data Science Environment with Rstudio
  * NB: We cover Python starting Block 06.
  * Using Git (via GitHub Desktop) for collaborative projects.

## Lectures:

* [01.1-Intro]({{ site.data.block01.s0101-Intro.url }})
* [01.2-EDA]({{ site.data.block01.s0102-EDA.url }})
  * [Reference R code]({{ site.data.block01.c0101-EDA.url }}) (NB: See 1.3.1 for explanation)

## Workshop:

In the workshop, we will be focussing on remote collaboration and working. This section uses the command line - see the [github appendix](appendix3-github.md) for details and additional tutorials.

* [{{ site.data.vid01.v0301.text }}]({{ site.data.vid01.v0301.url }})
  * [Rmd for 1.3.1 Introduction to R Studio]({{ site.data.block01.c0103-EDA.url }}) 
  * See [Appendix 1](appendix1-prep.md): Installing and working with Rstudio
* [{{ site.data.vid01.v0302.text }}]({{ site.data.vid01.v0302.url }}):
  * [Rmd for 1.3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis R markdown]({{ site.data.block01.s0103-EDA.url }}) 
  * [HTML for 1.3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis R markdown]({{ site.data.block01.s0103-EDA-h.url }}) 
  * (Warning: video uses a slightly out-of-date Rmd document.)
* 1.3.3 Workshop Lecture on Assessments
  * See [Appendix 3](appendix3-github.md): Installing and working with Github Desktop
  * Split into the following parts:
  - [{{ site.data.vid01.v030301.text }}]({{ site.data.vid01.v030301.url }})
  - [{{ site.data.vid01.v030302.text }}]({{ site.data.vid01.v030302.url }})
  - [{{ site.data.vid01.v030303.text }}]({{ site.data.vid01.v030303.url }})
  - 1.3.3.4 is discussing the Assignment, which we cover in class.
  - [{{ site.data.vid01.v. 30305.text }}]({{ site.data.vid01.v030305.url }}) ([Example Assessment link](https://github.com/dsbristol/dst_example_project))

## Assessments (Formative):

* [Portfolio 01]({{ site.data.block01.portfolio.url }}) long form worksheet.
* **Block01** on Noteable via [Blackboard](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_255714_1/cl/outline):
	* Go to the Data Science Toolbox blackboard page
	* Select Noteable
	* Select **R with stan** as your "personal notebook server" and press "Start"
	* Go to "Assignments"
	* Select **Block01** and press "Fetch"
	* Click **Block01>** which opens up a drop down containing the only assignment, **Block01**. Select this.
	* The assignment opens in Jupyter. Complete the worksheet. When you are done, **save** and return to the Assignments tab. Press **validate**, and when it is successful, press **submit**.

## Assessments:

* The [Example Assessment](https://github.com/dsbristol/dst_example_project) should be carefully examined.
* [Assessment 0]({{ site.data.assessment0.url }}) will be set in this week; see [Assessments](../assessments.md). This is a formative assessment (i.e. does not contribute to your grade) and will be due in Week 3.
* [Portfolio 0]({{ site.data.individualassessment0.url }}) will be set in this week; see [Assessments](../assessments.md). This is a formative assessment (i.e. does not contribute to your grade) and will be due in Week 3.

### Data Sources:

This section used Cyber Security Data Sources:

* Bro log data from [Secrepo](http://www.secrepo.com/Datasets%20Description/HTML_Bro_log_1/conn.html)
* This can be loaded into R in a nice form with a [script](https://github.com/dsbristol/dst/blob/master/code/loadconndata.R) ([raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsbristol/dst/master/code/loadconndata.R)) that can be run directly from R using `source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsbristol/dst/master/code/loadconndata.R`.
* The [KDD99](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) dataset, which was created for a competition with a [task specification](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/task.html). We normally use the [10%](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup.data_10_percent.gz) and [column names](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup.names) files, which you can download directly.

### Worksheets (unassessed)
