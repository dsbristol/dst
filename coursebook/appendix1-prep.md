# Appendix 1: Critical preparation

**Before the Block 1 Interactive Session** you must get the following software working on your computer:

* A working R environment:
  * [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) which will prompt you to install:
  * [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (if you have not already)
* A working [Git](appendix3-github.md) environment:
  * Note that this is addressed in [Workshop 1.3, the main workshop in Block 1](01.md)

**Before the Block 5 Workshop** you must get the following software working on your computer:

* Jupyter Notebook

**Useful options for group projects**:
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free online Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. It even has free access to GPUs.
  * No sensitive information can be used on Colab.
  * Collaboration is very straightforward in this environment.
* [Noteable](https://noteable.io) (accessed via [Blackboard](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_265312_1/outline)) is a University of Bristol subscribed service that provides Jupyter notebooks with access to University of Bristol HPC resources. It is free to use for University of Bristol students.
  * No sensitive information can be used on Noteable.
  * Noteable will time out long jobs.
