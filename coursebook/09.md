# 09 Perceptions and Neural Networks

In this block we cover:

* Introduction
  * Neurons
  * Single layer perceptron
  * Learning algorithms
* Deep Neural Networks
* Multi layer perceptron and the feed-forward neural network
  * Learning for deep neural networks
  * Other types of neural networks and their value:
	* Feed-forward
	* Convolutional
	* Recurrent
	* Recursive
	* Auto-encoders

## Lectures

* Neural Nets and the Perceptron
  * [{{ site.data.vid09.v0101.text }}]({{ site.data.vid09.v0101.url }})
    * [Slides]({{ site.data.block09.s0101.url }})
  * [{{ site.data.vid09.v0102.text }}]({{ site.data.vid09.v0102.url }})
    * [Slides]({{ site.data.block09.s0102.url }})
* Practicalities of Neural Nets
  * [{{ site.data.vid09.v02.text }}]({{ site.data.vid09.v02.url }})
    * [Slides]({{ site.data.block09.s02.url }})
	
## Worksheets:

* [Worksheet 9.1 Neural Networks]({{ site.data.block09.ws01.url }}) 

## Workshop:

* [{{ site.data.vid09.v03.text }}]({{ site.data.vid09.v03.url }})
  * [Python Notebook: Workshop 09.3 on Tensorflow with Keras]({{ site.data.block09.s03.url }})
* [Appendix 5 on Bluecrystal](appendix5-bluecrystal.md) has some specific advice on getting Tensorflow to work on Bluecrystal Phase 3.
* You need to understand how to run python as a script: [Neural Network run as a script.]({{ site.data.block09.s0302.url }}) 
  * This is run (for me) with `/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.7 block09-NeuralNetworksScript.py`
  * You will have to give it the right location of python
  * On Bluecrystal, if you followed the instructions to create `tf-env` then `python3` will do.
  * Remember to put the **data** and **python script** in the directory you are running in!
  * A script to run non-interactively could be called `block09-NeuralNetworksScript.sh` and would be submitted with `qsub block09-NeuralNetworksScript.sh`, containing the following:
  
```{sh}
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=2,walltime=1:00:00
module load languages/python-anaconda3-2019.10
eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)" # in interactive mode, conda activate doesn't get set up without this
conda activate tf-env
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
python3 block09-NeuralNetworksScript.py
```
